# Hygraph (GraphCMS), React Next.js, and GraphQL Demo

A project uses Hygraph (formerly GraphCMS) to store the content that is displayed by React Next.js version 13.

Hygraph is a database as a service that quickly allows data to be structured through a simple interface. After the shape of the data has been defined; Hygraph automatically creates form inputs and then exposes that data with GraphQL queries.

The frontend Next.js website connects to the Hygraph data using an API url and key that is stored within environment variables.
